# Emotion_Recognition
This project "Emotion Recognition" uses computer vision and deep learning techniques. In these we are used CNN as primary model and later tested on the RNN, CNN_LSTM, CNN_RNN, CNN(MobilenetV2) and traditional ML techinques SVM, KNN, Random_Forest, Logistic Regression, PCA and i used to deploy via Streamlit  and i trained on FER-2013 dataset(Kaggle)
=======
In these we have 5 dl models and 5 models 
In the CNN Custom Model has highest Accuracy and best real time performance it deployed or run via Streamlit
And additionally we have DL and ML models 
First we need to install the all the dependices(libraries)
Then we have run the ipynb(Jupyter files) and it will generate the models like (Deep learning has .h5 extension) and (Machine Learning has .pkl extension)
Then we need to run the Streamlit(open the terminal and run this command "streamlit run file_path" it will open the web broswer there is the output)
Thank you

# Emotion_Recognition

This project "Emotion Recognition" uses computer vision and deep learning techniques.  
We primarily used **CNN** as the main model and later tested **RNN, CNN_LSTM, CNN_RNN, CNN(MobileNetV2)** and traditional ML techniques such as **SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, PCA**.  
The project is deployed via **Streamlit** and trained on the **FER-2013 dataset (Kaggle)**.

---

We developed **5 deep learning models** and **5 machine learning models**.  
Among them, the **CNN Custom Model** achieved the highest accuracy and best real-time performance (deployed via Streamlit).  

### How to run:
1. Install all required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).  
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to generate models:
   - Deep Learning models → `.h5` files  
   - Machine Learning models → `.pkl` files  
3. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run <file_path>
